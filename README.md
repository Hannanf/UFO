<h2>Module 11 Challenge â€” Creating a website to display UFO Sightings and Using JavaScript to Create a Filter 
  </h2>
  
______________________________________________________________________
<h4>OVERVIEW 
</h4>

______________________________________________________________________
The purpose of this module is was to create a website and update UFO sighting data. We then used JavaScript to create a filter that the user could more easily search the sightings using the following metrics 

1) Date the UFO sighting was observed 
2) City in which the UFO was seen 
3) State in which the UFO was seen 
4) Country in which the UFO was seen 
5) Shape of the observed UFO

Below are images of the overview of the site (image 1), the filter section (image 2) as well as a sample filter performed along with the output generated (image 3)

<h4>SUMMARY
</h4>

______________________________________________________________________

1) Drawback - One drawback of the filter is that it will only accept specific values. For example it will only search for "ca" in the state field rather than "calfifornia" 

2) two additional recommendations for further development

a) Allow user input to be more flexible. for example the filter should accept both "ca" and "california" 
b) Allow user to submit their own UFO sightings
